**ReplicaSets** maintains a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time, which make your application self-healing by replicating pods and moving them around and spinning them up when nodes fail.

**Statefulsets** represent a set of Pods with unique, persistent identities and stable hostnames regardless of where they are scheduled.

## Hands-on

* The YAML for a ReplicaSet

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myreplicaset
  labels:
    app: app
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: linuxacademycontent/kubeserve
```

* Create the ReplicaSet

  `kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml`

* The YAML for a pod with the same label as a ReplicaSet

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: linuxacademycontent/kubeserve
```

* Create the pod with the same label

  `kubectl apply -f pod-replica.yaml`

* Watch the pod get terminated

  `kubectl get pods -w`

* The YAML for a StatefulSet

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

* Create the StatefulSet

  `kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml`

* View all StatefulSets in the cluster

  `kubectl get statefulsets`

* Describe the StatefulSets

  `kubectl describe statefulsets`
